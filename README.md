# IdeationFX

**A framework for working with AI while maintaining human agency and judgment.**

---

## What This Is

IdeationFX is a set of tools and practices for thinking with AI in a way that preserves clarity about where decisions are being made.

It grew out of noticing that AI conversations can drift in subtle ways - toward premature certainty, elegant-but-wrong coherence, or quiet erosion of human responsibility.

The tools here are designed to create friction at the right moments, maintain orientation during complex thinking, and keep the human clearly in charge.

## Quick Start

1. Read the [Primer Draft](Primer_Draft.md) to understand the context
2. Browse [The ToolBook](The_ToolBook_v1.1.2.md) to see what the tools do
3. Try using one or two tools in your next AI conversation
4. Keep what helps, drop what doesn't

## Status

This is early work - documented publicly but still evolving through use.

The core framework (v1.1.2) is frozen for testing, but the Primer and examples are in active development.

Nothing here requires belief or commitment. Try what seems useful, ignore the rest.

## Contributing

Not accepting contributions yet - this is still finding its shape through direct use.

If you try the tools and have observations, feel free to open an issue. Especially interested in:
- Where the tools helped (or didn't)
- Where the documentation was unclear
- Unexpected uses or adaptations

**On Ethical Use:**

This framework was built to preserve human agency and judgment. Using it to manipulate, coerce, or circumvent informed consent would contradict its fundamental purpose.

**On Attribution:**

If this work proves useful and evolves into something larger - conferences, gatherings, further development - the author would appreciate being invited to participate. But there's no requirement beyond the standard MIT attribution.
