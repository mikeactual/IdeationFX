# IdeationFX (working title)

This repository is a workspace for exploring how people think with AI.

It grew out of personal use rather than theory: long conversations, experiments, and moments where AI felt less like a tool and more like a thinking companion. The focus here isn’t on prompting, productivity hacks, or model mechanics. It’s on orientation — how thinking changes when the system you’re working with can respond, elaborate, and keep going.

The main artifact at the moment is a short **primer**, which lives in this repo as a working document. It captures the framing and posture behind the work, along with a bridge into a small set of practical tools that are still being written.

Over time, this repository may include:
- thinking tools and short practices
- notes and examples from real use
- drafts, revisions, and dead ends
- experiments that don’t pan out but still teach something

Nothing here is presented as finished or authoritative. This is a place to think in public, lightly, and revise as understanding improves.

If you’re reading this as a peer, feel free to skim, question, or ignore anything that doesn’t resonate. If you’re just browsing, the primer is the best place to start. If still curious The_Toolbook descibes the tools.
