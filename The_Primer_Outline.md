## Why These Tools Exist (Outline)

This document explains **why** the system exists, not how to run it.
It is for readers who want context, not instructions.

## 1. The Problem Space

- Why smart people get stuck

## 2. What This System Is (and Is Not)

- Not AI alignment theory

What it *is*:
- A set of diagnostic moves

## 3. The Core Failure Modes

- Elegant-but-wrong coherence
- Motivated reasoning
- Authority abdication to tools or AI
- Infinite polishing

- Why naming beats motivation
- Why diagnosis precedes planning

---

## 5. Human + AI, Properly Scoped

- What AI is good at
- What AI is bad at

## 7. How to Start (Without Belief)

- Start with WTF Tool
- Or start anywhere
- How to know when a tool is helping
- How to know when to stop

---

## 8. What Success Looks Like

- Less friction
- Earlier stopping
- Fewer false certainties
- More humane progress

## 9. What Comes Next
