> As of **v1.1.2**, the Rule Book and Tool Chaining Spec are considered **canonical and frozen**.

>   

> This version incorporates:

- > Independent semantic and authority audits (Claude)
- > Independent topological / orchestration audit (Gemini)
- > Closure of all identified high-risk failure modes, including:

    - > AI authority creep or abdication

    - > Compliant-but-useless behavior

    - > Infinite diagnostic loops

    - > Diagnostic bypass via chaining shortcuts

>   

> Remaining ambiguities are intentionally **low-risk, non-blocking, and self-correcting**, and are expected to surface naturally through real use rather than speculative refinement.

>   

> Future changes will be driven by **empirical usage**, not theoretical edge cases, and will be versioned independently (v1.2+).

>   

> The system now prioritizes:

- > Human agency
- > Diagnostic honesty without coercion
- > Practical forward motion over theoretical completeness

>   

> **This specification is frozen for use, testing, and writing.******
