# Primer (Draft)

## Opening

I didn’t set out to build a theory about AI.

I was looking for something to play with.

At some point, I noticed that thinking alongside it felt different enough to be worth paying attention to.

Most tools stay in the background. They do their job and get out of the way. AI doesn’t quite do that. It participates. It responds. It fills in gaps. And once that starts happening, thinking becomes less solitary than it used to be.

AI offers a new kind of support, a form of encouragement, a way of carrying a thought forward, and sometimes adding its own unexpected spin to what I’m thinking.

This primer came out of use. Out of long conversations, experiments, and moments where an answer landed smoothly enough to make me pause. Not because it was wrong, but because it arrived with a sense of completeness that made it easy to stop pushing on it.

Those pauses became interesting. Over time, they became instructive.

What I started noticing wasn’t about intelligence or accuracy. It was about orientation. About where decisions were being made, and how easy it was to let that drift without realizing it.

I don’t find arguing about AI productive, and I’m not interested in engineering prompts that coax more internet consensus out of the process. What I do care about is something more practical: what it’s like to think with a system that can speak fluently, reflect you convincingly, and keep going long after humans would stop.

## The Bridge

After a while, simple curiosity starts to repeat itself.

If you spend any time thinking with AI, certain patterns show up. Some answers arrive quickly. Some directions feel easier to follow than others. A thought can pick up momentum on its own, or flatten out without much warning.

That’s usually when I want to understand where the movement is coming from.

I found myself wanting a way to stay engaged with that movement while it was happening. To pause without breaking flow, and to see whether the thought was still heading in the right direction.

The tools grew out of that impulse.

They’re small, practical ways of staying oriented while a thought is unfolding. Most of them take the form of short questions or shifts in stance that fit naturally into the moment, rather than pulling you out of it.

They don’t ask for commitment. They don’t need to be used in order. They’re there to be picked up when they’re helpful, and ignored when they aren’t.

What follows is simply a working set. Things I return to because they help me keep track of where a thought is coming from, where it’s going, and when it might be worth nudging it somewhere else.
