# The ToolBook
## Human-Facing Guide to the Tools
### Aligned with Canonical Spec v1.1.2

This ToolBook is a **practical guide for humans**.
It explains what each tool is for, when to use it, and what it feels like in practice.

It is intentionally:
- Lightweight
- Non-authoritarian
- Usable mid-thought
- Safe to apply partially

This document does **not** define enforcement rules or orchestration logic.
Those live in the Rule Book and Chaining Spec.

## How to Use This Book

You do **not** need to use all tools.
You do **not** need to use them in order.
You do **not** need to believe anything to try them.

Pick one tool.
If it helps, keep it.
If it doesn’t, drop it.

## Foundational Move

### Cold Open — Start Anywhere

Use when:
- You’re stuck
- You don’t know what the problem is
- You need momentum without clarity

What it does:
- Lets you start without justification
- Creates a first foothold

What it doesn’t do:
- Decide direction
- Validate your plan
- Lock you into anything

---

## Core Tools

### WTF Tool — Name the Actual Work

Use when:
- You’re busy but unclear
- You feel friction or drift
- Things feel heavier than they should

Prompt yourself:
> “What am I actually trying to do right now?”

A good answer:
- Names a **concrete object**
- Is **actionable in this sitting**

---

### Raccoon Priors — Gather Without Judging

Use when:
- You have fragments but no structure
- You’re not ready to decide yet

What to do:
- Dump pieces
- Notes, thoughts, half-ideas
- No ordering, no prioritizing

Stop when:
- Patterns start repeating
- Or you feel the urge to plan

(Planning comes later. Diagnosis comes first.)

---

### Hole & Ladder — Depth Check

Use when:
- You don’t know whether to push forward or step back

Ask:
- Is this a **ladder** (solvable by steps)?
- Or a **hole** (misframed, blocked, or not ready)?

If ladder:
- Plan next steps

If hole:
- Reframe, pause, or accept limits

---

### Pirate’s Voice — Say the Uncomfortable Thing

Use when:
- You’re being polite with yourself
- Something feels dodged or softened

What it does:
- Surfaces a **hypothesis** about avoidance or motive

Important:
- This is not a verdict
- You are allowed to reject it

If it keeps missing:
- Stop using it and try a different tool

---

### Red String — Put Things in Order

Use when:
- You know *what* you’re doing
- But not *what comes first*

Do:
- Identify dependencies
- Decide first / next / never

This is planning — it works best **after diagnosis**.

---

## Calibration & Safety Tools

### Battery Check — Tired or Stuck?

Use when:
- Everything feels harder than it should
- You’re looping or forcing

Ask:
> “If I stepped away briefly, would this feel different?”

If yes:
- Rest helps

If no:
- You’re stuck, not tired

You can always override this.
Rest signals don’t erase progress.

---

### Are We There Yet? — Stop on Purpose

Use when:
- You’re polishing endlessly
- Returns are shrinking

Ask:
> “Will more work meaningfully improve this?”

If no:
- Stop
- Ship
- Move on

---

### Beautiful Mind Filter — Elegant but Wrong?

Use when:
- An idea feels *too* good
- Everything clicks suspiciously well

Ask:
- What would falsify this?
- What assumptions am I protecting?

This is for **narrative intoxication**, not everyday work.

---

### Wherefore Art Thou, AI? — Relationship Check

Use when:
- The AI feels unusually agreeable
- You feel validated but not helped

Ask:
- Is the AI mirroring me?
- Am I outsourcing judgment?

Reset the partnership if needed.

---

### Red Team Test — Stress the Big Idea

Use when:
- Stakes are high
- You want to see if something survives hostility

Rules:
- Let it be attacked
- Don’t defend immediately

If it survives, it’s stronger.
If it doesn’t, you learned something.

---

### AITA Test — Small Ethical Check

Use when:
- You’re justifying a decision
- Something feels off

Ask:
> “Am I being unfair to someone else — or to Future Me?”

The answer belongs to you.

---

### Be the Dodgeball — Change the Game

Use when:
- You’re stuck in fixation
- Pushing harder isn’t helping

Do something sideways.
Then return and reframe.

---

## Final Note

This system is not about control.
It’s about **clarity without coercion**.

If a tool stops helping, stop using it.

That’s working as intended.
